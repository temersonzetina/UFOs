# UFOs: The Truth is Out There

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that filters information about UFO sightings based on user inputs regarding date, location, and object shape. With fields for these inputs inserted, the webpage allows users to identify multiple criteria while exploring UFO sightings.

### Results
Users can insert any combination of date, city, state, country, and/or shape to observe results in the table of sighting data.

Filtering the table does not require that all inputs are completed; users can elect to be as broad or specific as they prefer. Note the example below, which filters results for just two inputs:

### Summary
Though the functionality of the webpage is reliable, the information available is limited. Sighting data describes incidents strictly from US locations in the year 2010. Presumably, there are far more recorded UFO sightings to learn about. Several recommendations for page improvements include to -

1. *Expand dataset:* The page's next developer should work to find, scrape, and incorporate much more data about UFO sightings.
2. *Table formatting:* A relatively simple set of edits relating to capitalization (i.e. of place names) would give the table a much more professional appearance.
